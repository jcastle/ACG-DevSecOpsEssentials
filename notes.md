## Introduction

- DevSecOps first published by Gartner in May 2016
- DevSecOps is about culture - attitudes and behavior in a social group
- Culture change is essential to sustain ongoing process improvement
- Cross functional teams must work together and everyone is responsible for security
- DevOps is not about tooling - its about process improvement
- To achieve goal of DevOps, quality software must be deployed faster
- "automate everything"
- Automation - SW version control, continuous integration, continuous testing, config management and deployment, continuous monitoring, containerization, and container orchestration
- Measuring DevSecOps
  - Deployment frequency - fast and frequent releases
  - Reduce lead time - code to cache lifecycle
  - Detection of threats, vulnerabilities, and malware
  - Mean time to repair and remediation
  - Efficiency of rollback and recovery

### Overview of DevSecOps

- Historically IT departments are separate - dev, security, and ops. Dev for app development, security for regulatory governance and compliance, and ops for maintaining data center infrastructure.
- Security monitoring - applications continuously monitored for vulnerabilities, often require refactor based on dependency library
- Release and adapt - performance often prompts subsequent iterations of software enhancement; adjust culture over time based on KPIs, supports faster time to market

### Cybersecurity Concepts - Part 1

- Attack surface and attack vectors
- Malware - malicious SW attackers use to attack individual computers
- Vulnerability - weakness in the system where malware can be introduced
- Open SCAP Project - collection of open-source tools for implementing and enforcing SCAP (NIST standard)
- Center for Internet Security - cookbooks for hardening developed by NIST
- Scanners - can monitor on hosts and in real time
  - Dynamic scanning - identifies vulnerabilities in a runtime environment
  - Static scanning - performed in non-runtime environment
- Cloud Security Alliance - consolidated most security compliance methods into the Clouds Control Matrix (CCM). CCM includes controls such as ISO, FedRamp, and NIST 800-53.
- Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)
- Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)
